    CSS Combinators Pt. 1

    In CSS, combinators are another form of communicating with HTML about which elements and segments of 
    code have particular styling applied to them. The difference is between combinators and selectors
    is that combinators depict relations between different blocks of code. This section of the website will
    describe the parent-child and ancestor-descendant combinators.
    
    >
    For example, the > symbol designates the relationship between a parent and child block of code:
    <!-- EXAMPLE: JavaScript Here -->
    Example 1 - 
    HTML:
    <code>
        &lt;parent&gt;
            &lt;child&gt;&lt;/child&gt;
        &lt;/parent&gt;
    </code>


    CSS:
    parent>child

    <!-- Border Here? -->

    [space]
    Similarly, the [space] symbol designates a similar relationship between a greater block of code and a lesser.
    This [space] symbol however more generally applies to any block of code within a greater initial
    block; not necessarily the code block directly underneath it. 

    This relationship is known as the ancestor-descendant:
    <!-- EXAMPLE: JavaScript Here -->
    Example 2 - 
    HTML:
    <code>
    &lt;ancestor&gt;{
        ...{
            ...{
                &lt;descendant&gt;
            }
        }
    }
    </code>

    CSS:
    ancestor descendant
    <p id = 'demo' style = 'display: none'>JavaScript Test.</p>
    <button type = 'button' id = "button" onclick = "toggleText()">Example 1</button>
</body>
<script src = dom.js></script>
</html>
